This project utilizes code to explore the realm of data analysis in response to data gathered in a previous study. For my IB psych class in high school I replicated the Peterson and Peterson 1959 study. The basis of the experiment was to understand the transfer of information between short and long term memory through rehearsal. Researchers asked participants to recall a series of trigrams which are meaningless three-consonant words such as TGH. Participants recalled the trigrams after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 seconds. Researchers utilized a specific technique to try and delay the percent of correctly recalled trigrams by having participants count backwards in threes and fours from a random specified number.

In the replication of the study I gathered and analyzed data about the number of accuratly recalled trigrams but explored a little further by looking at the effect of gender and age on recall of short term memory. During the period of data collection I utilized excel to plot the data. However, I wanted to analyze the data through python code and intertwine the worlds of coding and psychology as the reason behind me taking COGS18 was to fulfill a requirement for my psychology major. The results looked at the percent of correctly recalled trigrams (set of 3) through the different time increments and compares the percentages with different age groups and genders.
